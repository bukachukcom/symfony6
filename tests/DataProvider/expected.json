[{"title":"Microsoft's AI tool can turn photos into realistic videos of people talking and singing","text":"Microsoft Research Asia has unveiled a new experimental AI tool called VASA-1 that can take a still image of a person \u2014 or the drawing of one \u2014 and an existing audio file to create a lifelike talking face out of them in real time. It has the ability to generate facial expressions and head motions for an existing still image and the appropriate lip movements to match a speech or a song. The researchers uploaded a ton of examples on the project page, and the results look good enough that they could fool people into thinking that they're real.While the lip and head motions in the examples could still look a bit robotic and out of sync upon closer inspection, it's still clear that the technology could be misused to easily and quickly create deepfake videos of real people. The researchers themselves are aware of that potential and have decided not to release \"an online demo, API, product, additional implementation details, or any related offerings\" until they're sure that their technology \"will be used responsibly and in accordance with proper regulations.\" They didn't, however, say whether they're planning to implement certain safeguards to prevent bad actors from using them for nefarious purposes, such as to create deepfake porn or misinformation campaigns.The researchers believe their technology has a ton of benefits despite its potential for misuse. They said it can be used to enhance educational equity, as well as to improve accessibility for those with communication challenges, perhaps by giving them access to an avatar that can communicate for them. It can also provide companionship and therapeutic support for those who need it, they said, insinuating the VASA-1 could be used in programs that offer access to AI characters people can talk to.According to the paper published with the announcement, VASA-1 was trained on the VoxCeleb2 Dataset, which contains \"over 1 million utterances for 6,112 celebrities\" that were extracted from YouTube videos. Even though the tool was trained on real faces, it also works on artistic photos like the Mona Lisa, which the researchers amusingly combined with an audio file of Anne Hathaway's viral rendition of Lil Wayne's Paparazzi. It's so delightful, it's worth a watch, even if you're doubting what good a technology like this can do.This embedded content is not available in your region.This article contains affiliate links; if you click such a link and make a purchase, we may earn a commission."},{"title":"Finally, someone used Pareto\u2019s economic theories to find the best Mario Kart 8 racer","text":"Who hasn\u2019t spent sleepless nights pondering what would happen if we applied Vilfredo Pareto's (the early 20th-century Italian economist) theories to Mario, the Mushroom Kingdom\u2019s Italian high-jump champion and part-time elephant cosplayer? Data scientist Antoine Mayerowitz, PhD, tackled that age-old question, and the resulting work provides an objective way to tell us the best Mario Kart 8 racer combinations. Hint: It sure as hell ain\u2019t Koopa Troopa.When you break down the build options (including driver stats and various vehicle details) in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, there are over 700,000 possible combinations. Yikes. But once you eliminate duplicates that differ only in appearance, you can narrow it down to \u201conly\u201d 25,704 possibilities. How do you narrow it down to find the best racer from there? Enter Mr. Pareto.Pareto\u2019s theories, most notably the Pareto front, help us navigate the complexities of choice. They can pinpoint the solutions with the most balanced strengths and the fewest trade-offs. Pareto\u2019s work is about efficiency and effectiveness. Now we\u2019re talking. NintendoWhen choosing a Mario Kart racer, you have to consider their stats for speed, acceleration, handling, weight, offroad and mini turbo. That\u2019s a lot to weigh.Even if you decide that speed and acceleration are the most important, you\u2019re still left with imbalances. For example, it\u2019s tempting to go all in on speed (like Bowser or Wario), but they have weak acceleration. However, if you prioritize acceleration instead (such as Baby Mario or Dry Bones), you may be left with quick surges that plateau at a lousy top speed.Meanwhile, some racers are always dominated in the most important stats \u2014 meaning their balance of speed and acceleration consistently comes out behind. Koopa is one example of that, so don\u2019t pick him if you care about winning. (But you can absolutely choose him because he has cute bug eyes and a snazzy shell.) NintendoMayerowitz\u2019s Pareto front analysis lets you narrow your possibilities down to the 14 most efficient. And it turns out the game\u2019s top players were onto something: One of the combinations with the most ideal balance of speed, acceleration and mini-turbo is Cat Peach driving the Teddy Buggy, roller tires and cloud glider \u2014 one already favored among Mario Kart 8 competitors.Of course, if that combination isn\u2019t your cup of tea, there are others that allow you to stay within the Pareto front\u2019s optimal range. As Eurogamer points out, Donkey Kong, Wario (my old standby, mostly because he makes me laugh) and Princess Peach are often highlighted as drivers, and you can use Mayerowitz\u2019s data fields to find the best matching vehicles. Keep in mind that others have identical stats, so racers like Villager (female), Inkling Girl and Diddy Kong are separated only by appearances.To find your ideal racer, you can head over to Mayerowitz\u2019s website. There, you can enter your most prized stats and view the combos that give you the best balance (those highlighted in yellow), according to Pareto\u2019s theories."},{"title":"Rebel Moon Part 2 review: A slow-mo sci-fi slog","text":"Rebel Moon: Part 2 - The Scargiver is an empty feast. It's a relentless onslaught of explosions, sci-fi tropes and meaningless exposition that amounts to nothing. And yet somehow it's still better than the first film in Zack Snyder's wannabe sci-fi epic franchise for Netflix, Rebel Moon: Part 1 - A Child of Fire. (What do these titles really mean? Who cares.)With all of the dull table-setting complete, Snyder is able to let his true talents soar in Rebel Moon: Part 2 by delivering endless battles filled with slow-motion action and heroic poses. It looks cool, I just wish it added up to something. Anything.Spoilers ahead for Rebel Moon: Part 2.If you somehow missed the first Rebel Moon film, the basic setup is that it's Star Wars meets The Seven Samurai. Sofia Boutella stars as Kora, a former elite soldier of an evil empire who is hiding out in an all-too idyllic farming village, just planting and harvesting her days away. When a group of military baddies kills the chief of the village and starts threatening a young girl, Kora goes on a murdering spree (in defense!), leaving the community open to a retaliatory attack.She spends the first movie recruiting potential warriors to defend the village, including a fallen gladiator (Djimoun Hounsou) and a bad-ass swordswoman (Doona Bae). (Their names are Titus and Nemesis, respectively, but those don't really matter because the characters are paper thin.)Full disclosure: I tried writing a review for the first Rebel Moon and just gave up in disgust. It was a shockingly boring epic, so much so that it took me several days to watch without falling asleep. By the end, I was only left with a feeling of dread, knowing that there was still another two hours of Rebel Moon ahead of me.It's somewhat empty praise, but at least I didn't fall asleep during The Scargiver. Mostly, that's due to the film actually having a sense of momentum and a lot more action. You can turn off your brain and enjoy the pretty pictures, much like you could for Snyder's Sucker Punch, Justice League and Watchmen adaptation. He's more a stylist than a natural storyteller, but occasionally Snyder's visuals, such as a baffling montage of our heroes harvesting wheat, can be almost poetic. NetflixIt's just a shame that I didn't care much about the film's characters or any aspect of its story. James Gunn's Guardian's of the Galaxy trilogy made us fall in love with a band of misfits and screwups, with storylines that directly led to their personal and emotional growth. The crew in Rebel Moon, instead, feel like cardboard cutouts from better movies, and the overall plot feels forced (there's even setup for another film by the end).Hounsou tries to sell the pathos of Titus with his eyes, but he can only do so much. And while Bae's warrior woman exudes cool (and has a very compelling flashback), she's mostly wasted when the action really heats up. Then there's Jimmy, a robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins, who is briefly introduced in the first film and pops up for a few minutes here to kick butt. Why? It doesn't matter. Somehow that character is also important enough to serve as the narrator for both Rebel Moon films (but really it seems Snyder just wanted Hopkins' voice adding gravitas).Perhaps the only real saving grace for Rebel Moon: Part 2, much like the first film,\u00a0is Ed Skrein as the villainous Atticus Noble. As a sadistic baddie, he's really nothing new, but Skrein's heightened scenery chomping makes the character interesting to watch. Where Darth Vader exudes a calm sense of dread, Skrein's Noble is entertainingly chaotic, like the Joker crossed with Christoph Waltz's Hans Landa from Inglorious Basterds. He just has a lot of fun being bad \u2014 that's something!Given how popular the first film was (according to Snyder and Netflix, anyway), we'll likely see more Rebel Moon down the line. Snyder previously said he'd like to do a six-hour director's cut of both films, and he recently told Radio Times that he'd like to stretch the Rebel Moon series out to four or six films. Somehow, that just feels like a threat."},{"title":"Prison Architect 2 is denied release until September 3","text":"It hasn't been a great week for Paradox Interactive, and things just got a little worse for the publisher. It has announced another delay for Prison Architect 2, the sequel to a cult hit from 2015. The game had been set to drop on May 7 (which was already a delay from March 26) but now it won't arrive until September 3.Though builds of Prison Architect 2 had been certified for all platforms, the developers at Double Eleven ran into some technical problems that will take some time to resolve. Some issues concerning memory usage and minimum spec configuration failures emerged. Although the team says its work on fixing those have been successful so far, some other technical challenges started popping up, leading to significantly more crashes.Double Eleven will use the extra development time to improve the prison management sim's stability and to refine some of its features. Paradox says it will also take the opportunity to let players get a look inside the development process via additional developer diaries and streams. A stream is set for April 25.Paradox notes that console players who pre-ordered will automatically be refunded due to platform policies \u2014 they'll need to buy Prison Architect 2 again to get a pre-order bonus. Steam players can request a refund if they wish.The Prison Architect 2 delay comes one day after studio Colossal Order said it would refund all players who bought the first asset pack for Cities Skylines 2, another game Paradox is publishing. While the asset pack (which will be added to the base game for everyone) worked, there appeared to be a consensus among fans that there wasn't enough in there to justify the $10 price. There are bigger issues at play though, as Colossal Order has more work ahead to optimize Cities Skylines 2 after a rocky debut. The studio has also delayed the console release and other DLC as it focuses on fixing the core concerns."},{"title":"Ryan Gosling and Miller\/Lord\u2019s Project Hail Mary could be the sci-fi event of 2026","text":"Do you like rip-roaring science fiction books? Do you like movies? Then you are in for a treat in, well, two years. Amazon MGM Studios just set a release date of March 20, 2026 for Project Hail Mary, according to Deadline. It\u2019s based on the Andy Weir novel of the same name, which was one of our favorite books of the past few years, so color us excited.The film stars honorary SNL cast member Ryan Gosling and will be directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the duo behind The Lego Movie and, allegedly, most of the good parts of Solo: A Star Wars Story. Lord also wrote a little-known movie called Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.The script was penned by Drew Goddard, who cut his teeth on TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Lost before moving onto features. He directed Cabin in the Woods, which is somehow both iconic and underrated at the same time. If the name Andy Weir sounds familiar, it\u2019s because he wrote a book called The Martian, which inspired the Matt Damon film. Incidentally, Goddard also wrote that script.This summary of Project Hail Mary, clearly written by an AI, just gets more and more wild as you continue reading: https:\/\/t.co\/XeuITzFVBG\u2014 Andy Weir (@andyweirauthor) March 10, 2024I\u2019ve read the book and loved it. It\u2019s more fantastical than The Martian, but still filled with the same science-based solutions to massive life-or-death problems. This time, the entire Earth is on the chopping block, instead of one lone astronaut. It\u2019s also pretty dang funny, just like The Martian, so Lord and Miller are a good match to direct. The pair also signed on to direct an adaptation of another Weir novel, Artemis, but that project looks to have stalled.Or course, a lot can happen in two years. Here\u2019s to hoping our humble little society keeps clunking along so we can chomp down some popcorn in 2026. Speaking of, that year will also see the release of The Mandalorian & Grogu, the Rey Skywalker film, the sequel to The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Toy Story 5, The Batman Part II and, reportedly, Avengers: The Kang Dynasty."},{"title":"Some of our favorite Anker power banks are up to 30 percent off, plus the rest of this week's best tech deals","text":"Before you head into the weekend to hike, pull weeds, play games or go to work, you may feel a hankering to snap up a few tech gadgets.

The sale includes 25 percent off the price of the 10,000mAh Qi2 MagGo Power Bank, which brings it down to $67.50 from $90. Just note that the deal only apples to the white model.\u00a0 We named the portable charger the best MagSafe-enabled banks in our guide. It's Qi2-certified and brought an iPhone 15 from four percent to half full in around 45 minutes in our tests. It delivered a full charge plus an additional 70 percent before needing a refill. I also appreciated the display that shows the amount of charge the bank has left and the kickstand so you can watch something while you refuel. The 552 USB-C Hub is also part of the sale and down to $30 after a big 57 percent discount. You can also save on Anker's Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank with the 100W Charging Base included. It's down to $164.50 from $235 and is another top pick in our buyer's guide to power banks.\u00a0 $67 at AmazonAmazonEcho Pop with a TP-Link Kasa Smart Color Bulb$23$63Save $40Save yourself from having to manually turn on a light with this bundle that includes Amazon's smallest smart speaker, the Echo Pop, and a TP-Link Kasa smart bulb. The set is now $23, down from $63 if you bought them both at full price (though they're currently on sale separately, so really the bundle represents a $22 savings). The Kasa bulb made the cut in our guide to smart bulbs. The larger Echo Dot speaker is also on sale, bundled with the same bulb, for $40. The Echo Dot is our top pick for a smart speaker under $50 because it puts out big sound for its size, has handy physical controls and grants access to Alexa's helpfulness \u2014 a selling point if you prefer that assistant's capabilities over another. $23 at AmazonAmy Skorheim for EngadgetKasa Smart Plug Mini EP25 (4-pack)$33$50Save $17Our favorite smart plug is currently on sale at Amazon. A four-pack of the Kasa EP25 smart plug is down to $32.58 instead of $50 after a 25 percent discount and an on-page $5 coupon.\u00a0 The Kasa EP25 works with Alexa, Google Home, HomeKit and Samsung SmartThings. I found the connection to be stable and the initial setup was quick to do through the companion app. Once initialized, it's easy to add the plug to whichever smart home eco system you rely on.\u00a0 Amazon's Smart Plug is also on sale for $20 instead of $25. Our guide calls it the best smart plug for Alexa-enabled homes, so if you already have a few Amazon Echo speakers at home, the plug will make a good addition. The only real advantage is has over the Kasa plug is its near-instant pairing with Alexa. $33 at AmazonSonosRefurbished Sonos Arc SL soundbar$509$679Save $170Sonos not only makes quality speakers, they also have a respectable refurbished program which can save you some cash on the otherwise pricey audio equipment. Right now, a refurbished Sonos Arc SL soundbar is down to $509, which is $170 off the renewed price and $240 off the speaker's full $749 price tag when it was new. A decent selection of similarly like-new soundbars and speakers are also on sale, with up to 25 percent off the refurb prices. That includes our pick for a midrange soundbar, the second-generation Beam soundbar. It's down to $299 after a $100 discount off the refurbished rate. We named the Sonos Arc the runner-up premium soundbar in our buying guide, praising its stellar sound quality and ability to calibrate its sound to match the room its in. Compared to the standard Arc, the Arc SL lacks a microphone, so you won't be able to use voice assistants directly from the soundbar.\u00a0 Sonos refurbished gear comes with the same, one-year warranty, all necessary cables and manuals plus all-new packaging. They also donate one percent of refurbished sales to environmental non-profits as part of 1% for the Planet. $509 at SonosiRobotRoomba Combo J9+$999$1,399Save $400 with codeRight now a code at Wellbots will get you iRobot\u2019s flagship Roomba Combo J9+ for $400 off. The vacuum-mop hybrid robot, which only arrived last fall, automatically empties itself and refills the device\u2019s mopping liquid. That convenience doesn't come cheap, though. The unit usually sells for $1,399 but enter the coupon code ENGA400 at Wellbots and get it for $999 instead.\u00a0 Engadget's Devindra Hardawar gave the Combo J9+ an 85 review score when it first came out, calling it a godsend for tired parents. It's also our pick for the best combo vacuuming-mopping robot. It has an upgraded motor and four-stage cleaning system that takes multiple pass-throughs across your carpets and floors. The base that empties the debris and refills the mop solution also doubles as a storage unit that looks more like living room furniture. Setup is as simple as adding water and cleaning solution to a reservoir and attaching a mop pad. Upkeep is limited to swapping mop pads and leaning the vacuum\u2019s bristles and dust bin. If you don\u2019t need a mop you can save some cash by going with the standard Roomba J9+ $599, which is $300 with the code ENGA300. It includes all the vacuum-related features from the more expensive Combo variant, including a three-stage cleaning system, multi-surface rubber brushes and stronger suction.

It can be used indoors or outdoors, though it needs a weather-resistant power adapter for use outside. A bundle with the adapter is on sale as well. The camera shoots HD footage day or night and has an LED spotlight.\u00a0 Amazon-owned Blink announced the Mini 2 camera in March, touting improvements to image quality and the option for HD night view in color thanks to the spotlight. The camera also has motion detection and two-way audio. The camera can detect motion, and alert you when it does, but if you want person detection and the ability to live-stream continuously (up to 90 minutes), you'll need a Blink subscription. The Mini 2 comes with a 30-day free trial of the Blink Subscription Plan, too. After that, it's $3 per month per device or $10 monthly for unlimited coverage. $30 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$30 at Kohl's$40 at Lowe'sGoogleGoogle Nest Security Cam (Wired) - 2nd Generation$70$100Save $30If you'd prefer security cameras made by a different tech company, you can get Google's wired Nest security camera for $70, which is 30 percent off and its lowest price to date. The deal is available at Amazon, Walmart and directly from Google.\u00a0 The Nest Cam uses AI to discern between people, animals and vehicles and sends alerts via the Google Home app, and, unlike Blink cams, you don't need a subscription for that. The Nest Aware plan does let you save 60 days of video history, however, otherwise you get three free hours of history.

While it's a great deal, the discount is likely due to the fact that we expect Google to announce a new Pixel 8a phone at its I\/O conference next month. But if you don't need the most recent model, you can grab this deal. It's available via Amazon, Best Buy, Target and Google's online store.\u00a0 The Pixel 7a is the budget recommendation in our guide to the best Android phones, and Engadget's Sam Rutherford gave it a score of 90 in our review last May. It's also worth noting that the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are on sale for $549 and $799, respectively, though neither of those are all-time lows. $349 at AmazonQuickenQuicken Simplify Subscription $2 per month$4 per monthSave $2Annual subscriptions to the budgeting app Quicken Simplifi are half off through April 21. It has dropped from $4 monthly to $2 per month, billed annually at $24.\u00a0 Quicken Simplify topped both our list of the best budgeting apps and our collection of the best apps to replace Mint. We like the user-friendly interface and instantaneous access to various metrics, like top-line balances, net worth, recent spending, upcoming recurring payments and more. It also lets you set up customized savings goals and the clean UI keeps things interesting with playful animations. .You can also invite a spouse or a financial manager to co-manage the account.\u00a0 $2 per month at QuickenPhoto by Nathan Ingraham \/ EngadgetApple iPad (10th gen)$349$449Save $100The 10th-gen Apple iPad is on sale for $349 at Amazon and Best Buy, which matches the lowest price we've seen from major retailers. The deal applies to the base model with 64GB of storage. The 256GB model is also $100 off the list price and down to $499. Keep in mind that Apple reportedly plans to release new iPad Airs and iPad Pros in early May, so you may want to wait to see what is announced \u2014 and whether today's models drop even further. The standard iPad may not be refreshed until later this year.\u00a0 We gave the 10th-gen iPad a review score of 85 in late 2022. Its aluminum design feels premium, it gets a solid 10-plus hours of battery life and its A14 Bionic chip is still plenty fast for media consumption \u2014 though its the only remaining iPad without an M-series chip and it only works with the older generation Apple Pencil and requires an adapter.\u00a0 $349 at AmazonPhoto by Jeff Dunn \/ Engadget8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller$60$70Save $108BitDo's Ultimate Bluetooth Controller is $60 right now on Amazon. Last week it dropped to $59.49, but only for Amazon Prime members. Neither deal is an all-time low, but still around $10 off the list price. Engadget's Jeff Dunn is a fan of the wireless Switch and PC gamepad and its Hall effect joysticks, which use magnets to read inputs, making them less susceptible to \"drift\" over time. While it may be a touch small for those with especially large hands, it has a sturdy design, customizable buttons and comes with a charging dock.\u00a0 $60 at AmazonGoogleChromecast with Google TV (HD)$20$30Save $10If you're looking for a smart TV streaming dongle and don't need 4K video, check out this sale on the Chromecast with Google TV (HD). It's dwon to $20, which is $10 off the list price and close to the all-time low. You can get the same deal from Amazon, Target or directly from Google. This is the HD version of our top choice for streaming devices. We were impressed by the user interface which does a good job of integrating all the various services you subscribe to in one place. There's a universal search function and the setup is relatively easy: Just plug it into your TV's HDMI port and give it power with the included USB cable and power adapter. Then use the Google Home app to get things going.\u00a0 Of course, if you've got a 4K TV and want to see that higher def content, you'll want the more expensive model, though that one isn't on sale.\u00a0 $20 at AmazonExplore More Buying Options$30 at Lowe'sPhoto by Jeff Dunn \/ EngadgetAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max$40$60Save $20The newest Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max is still sale for $40, which ties the lowest price we've tracked. The 4K Max is Amazon's fastest and most featured streaming stick and supports HDR formats, Dolby Atmos audio and WiFi 6E. The user interface isn't as streamlined as other streaming devices and the homepage and search heavily promote Amazon's own content. But the sticks recommended in our buying guide \u2014 from Roku and Google \u2014 aren't on sale right now.\u00a0 The standard Fire TV Stick 4K is also back on sale for $30.

Best Buy has the pair for a dollar more. Engadget's Billy Steele gave the second-gen AirPods Pro a score of 88 back in 2022 and they're our top pick for iOS devices. Note that new AirPods are likely on the horizon, but new AirPods Pro reportedly aren't coming until 2025. $189 at AmazonHisenseHisense U6K 4K TV (55-inch)$350$450Save $100The 55-inch Hisense U6K TV is down to an all-time low of $350 at Best Buy, which is roughly $50 below the average street price we've seen over the last few months. The U6K is a budget-level TV from 2023 that's received almost universally high marks from reviewers we trust. It's one of the only TVs in its price range with quantum-dot color, a mini-LED backlight and full-array local dimming, so it should provide better contrast and color volume than most cheap sets. It's still not ideal for gaming, as it lacks HDMI 2.1 features and is limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. Its brightness levels won't blow anyone away, either. But at this price, it looks to be a great value.\u00a0 It's worth noting that this TV's successor, the U6N, recently went on sale and promises even better brightness and contrast. However, that one currently costs $600 for a 55-inch set. For now, the older model should remain the better value for most people. \u2014 Jeff Dunn, Senior Commerce Writer $350 at Best BuyFollow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice."},{"title":"Automate your vacuuming and mopping with $400 off the Roomba Combo J9+","text":"If you\u2019re looking to automate more of your home cleaning setup, iRobot\u2019s flagship Roomba Combo J9+ is on sale for $400 off.

Setup is as simple as adding water and cleaning solution to a reservoir and attaching a mop pad. Upkeep is limited to swapping mop pads and leaning the vacuum\u2019s bristles and dust bin.The Combo J9+ ships with Roomba\u2019s OS 7, a new software update that streamlines more of the cleaning process. Its Dirt Detective feature remembers your home\u2019s dirtiest areas and tackles those first on subsequent cleanings.The software has an automated setting that saves bathrooms for last, so you don\u2019t have to worry about tracking grime and bacteria to other parts of your home. (You can manually override that if you want it to get to the bathroom earlier.) Speaking of bathrooms, the machine includes iRobot\u2019s Pet Owner Official Promise (P.O.O.P.), which guarantees a replacement unit if your device accidentally sweeps up pet waste. iRobotFor those who don\u2019t mop much, Wellbots also has the standard Roomba J9+ for $300 off ($599) when you use code ENGA300. It includes all the vacuum-related features from the more expensive Combo variant, including a three-stage cleaning system, multi-surface rubber brushes and stronger suction.Finally, the previous-generation Roomba Combo j7+ offers an older (but still high-end) vacuum-mop cleaning robot for $200 off with coupon code ENGA200. Although you lose some of the features of the newer model, it still has a 96.4 percent debris removal rate, obstacle avoidance, and a four-stage cleaning system. Its cleaning toolbox includes an edge-sweeping brush, dual multi-surface rubber brushes, power-lifting suction and the mop. The device can even return to its base when it\u2019s full and continue emptying itself for up to 60 days, leaving you to focus on things that aren\u2019t cleaning.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribe to the Engadget Deals newsletter for the latest tech deals and buying advice."},{"title":"Tesla is recalling Cybertrucks because their accelerator pedals could get stuck","text":"Tesla has issued a recall for around 3,878 Cybertruck vehicles, a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration notice has revealed. Apparently, the cover of the truck's accelerator pedal could get dislodged and trapped by the interior rim. Based on videos going around showing the problem, a faulty accelerator cover could slide up due to excessive lubricant, jamming one end into a crevice while it's still also attached to the pedal itself. That means the vehicle could get stuck accelerating in full power even after the driver lifts their foot.Tesla said in the notice that it will replace and repair the pedals as needed free of charge. The automaker will send notices to owners of recalled Cybertrucks in June, but affected drivers who want their vehicles to be fixed as soon as possible can also call the company's customer service number at +1-877-798-3752. If asked for reference, they can say that the recall service number for their issue is SB-24-33-003.Cybertruck buyers were recently informed that their deliveries had been delayed and were reportedly told that Tesla was going to issue a recall over a problem with the vehicle's accelerator. It followed an earnings call earlier this month, wherein the company revealed that it experienced its first year-over-year drop in deliveries since 2020. Tesla didn't share how many Cybertrucks it shipped exactly, but its shipments were down 20 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 and eight percent compared to the same period a year ago. A couple of weeks later, reports came out that the company is laying off more than 10 percent of its workforce to reduce costs and increase productivity. While all that information only came out over the past month, Tesla has been expecting a leaner year from the start, with Elon Musk previously warning shareholders that they will likely see \"notably lower\" sales growth for 2024."},{"title":"Engadget Podcast: PlayStation 5 Pro rumors and a look back at the Playdate","text":"The latest batch of rumors make it pretty clear that a PlayStation 5 Pro is coming this year, but will anyone really care about slightly better 4K graphics?

If you were ever worried about its fate despite the success it enjoyed, you can rest easy, for now: Amazon has already renewed the show for a second season, mere days after the first one debuted. The Fallout universe is set in a post-apocalyptic world, decades after a nuclear war decimated the planet. Ella Purnell plays Lucy in the series, a vault dweller who was forced to go to the surface to rescue her father.Walton Goggins seems to be a hit with audiences as the Ghoul, a radioactive noseless bounty-hunting corpse. We called him an \"enlightened choice\" for the role in our review and found this to be his most engaging performance yet. As a whole, we liked Fallout almost as much as we liked the TV adaptation of the The Last of Us. It features fantastic visuals with detailed sets and costumes that stay true to the source materials, and it has a story that flows well and doesn't feel like it's struggling to juggle several different plotlines. The game is also violent and gory, though, and it's not really for the faint of heart.The show is one of Amazon's projects under executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the creators of Westworld, who Prime Video signed back in 2019. \"We can\u2019t wait to blow up the world all over again,\" Nolan and Joy said, indicating that they'll be back for the next season, though Amazon has yet to announce when it will begin production or if it has a timeline for the project."},{"title":"Baldur's Gate 3 developer confirms it won't make the sequel","text":"The developer behind the popular, award-winning and slightly bawdy Baldur's Gate 3 confirmed that it won't be doing Baldur's Gate 4 \u2014 but it does have other irons in the fire.\"We won't be introducing any major new narrative content to the story of Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3) or its origin characters and companions, nor will we be making expansions or Baldur\u2019s Gate 4,\" Larian Studio wrote in a community update on Steam. \"We\u2019re currently working on two new projects and we couldn\u2019t be more excited about what the future has in store.\"Larian promised more news about the new games \"later down the line,\" but did give a hint about the style. \"Know that even as our focus turns to these new games, the sensibilities that brought you Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 are alive and well here at the Larian castle. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to pull it off, but looking at our narrative, visual and gameplay plans, I think what we\u2019re working on now will be our best work ever.\"Baldur's Gate 3 has been praised for its breadth, character development, puzzles, combat, D&D fidelity and, of course, intimate relationships. It sold around 15 million copies, far exceeding the expectations of the studio, while pretty much sweeping game accolades over the last year. Namely, it took game of the year prizes at The Game Awards, The Steam Awards, D.I.C.E. awards, Streamer Awards, Hugo Awards, GLAAD Media Awards and others.Director Swen Vincke previously revealed that the studio dropped plans for BG3 DLC and a sequel, partly due to constraints imposed by the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition mechanics. Still, there's no question of a sequel for the Hasbro-owned property. \"We've done our job. It's a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. So let's pass the torch to another studio to pick up this incredible legacy,\" he added."},{"title":"Apple says it was ordered to remove WhatsApp and Threads from China App Store","text":"Apple users in China won't be able to find and download WhatsApp and Threads from the App Store anymore, according to The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. The company said it pulled the apps from the store to comply with orders it received from Cyberspace Administration, China's internet regulator, \"based on [its] national security concerns.\" It explained to the publications that it's \"obligated to follow the laws in the countries where [it operates], even when [it disagrees].\"The Great Firewall of China blocks a lot of non-domestic apps and technologies in the country, prompting locals to use VPN if they want to access any of them. Meta's Facebook and Instagram are two of those applications, but WhatsApp and Threads have been available for download until now. The Chinese regulator's order comes shortly before the Senate is set to vote on a bill that could lead to a TikTok ban in the US.

The legislation sailed through the House of Representatives last month, but faced an uncertain future in the Senate due to opposition from a few prominent lawmakers.But momentum for the \u201cProtecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act\u201d seems to once again be growing. The House is set to vote on a package of bills this weekend, which includes a slightly revised version of the TikTok bill. In the latest version of the bill, ByteDance would have up to 12 months to divest TikTok, instead of the six-month period stipulated in the original measure.That change, as NBC News notes, was apparently key to winning over support from some skeptical members of the Senate, including Sen. Maria Cantwell, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee. So with the House expected to pass the revised bill Saturday \u2014 it\u2019s part of a package that also includes aid to Ukraine and Israel \u2014 its path forward is starting to look much more certain, with a Senate vote coming \u201cas early as next week,\u201d according to NBC. President Joe Biden has said he would sign the bill if it\u2019s passed by Congress.If passed into law, TikTok (and potentially other apps \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" and deemed to be a national security threat) would face a ban in US app stores if it declined to sell to a new owner. TikTok CEO Shou Chew has suggested the company would likely mount a legal challenge to the law.\u201cIt is unfortunate that the House of Representatives is using the cover of important foreign and humanitarian assistance to once again jam through a ban bill that would trample the free speech rights of 170 million Americans, devastate 7 million businesses, and shutter a platform that contributes $24 billion to the U.S. economy, annually,\u201d TikTok said in a statement."},{"title":"Netflix is done telling us how many people use Netflix","text":"Netflix will stop disclosing the number of people who signed up for its service, as well as the revenue it generates from each subscriber from next year, the company announced on Thursday. It will focus, instead, on highlighting revenue growth and the amount of time spent on its platform.\u201cIn our early days, when we had little revenue or profit, membership growth was a strong indicator of our future potential,\u201d the company said in a letter to shareholders. \u201cBut now we\u2019re generating very substantial profit and free cash flow.\u201dNetflix revealed that the service added 9.33 million subscribers over the last few months, bringing the total number of paying households worldwide to nearly 270 million. Despite its decision to stop reporting user numbers each quarter, Netflix said that the company will \u201cannounce major subscriber milestones as we cross them,\u201d which means we\u2019ll probably hear about it when it crosses 300 million.Netflix estimates that more than half a billion people around the world watch TV shows and movies through its service, an audience it is now figuring out how to squeeze even more money out of through new pricing tiers, a crackdown on password-sharing, and showing ads. Over the last few years, it has also steadily added games like the Grand Theft Auto trilogy, Hades, Dead Cells, Braid, and more, to its catalog.Subscriber metrics are an important signal to Wall Street because they show how quickly a company is growing. But Netflix\u2019s move to stop reporting these is something that we\u2019ve seen from other companies before. In February, Meta announced that it would no longer break out the number of daily and monthly Facebook users each quarter but only reveal how many people collectively used Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. In 2018, Apple, too, stopped reporting the number of iPhones, iPads, and Macs it sold each quarter, choosing to focus, instead, on how much money it made in each category."},{"title":"Blizzard takes aim at Overwatch 2 console cheaters","text":"Like many other multiplayer games, Overwatch 2\u00a0isn't immune from cheaters. And it's not only an issue on PC, where cheaters use tools like aimbots. Some folks use XIM devices so they can play with a keyboard and mouse (KBM) on consoles. This is against Blizzard's rules, as KBM players typically have an aim advantage over those who use a controller, even though the console versions of the game have features like aim assist. While it's taken some time to get the ball rolling, the developer is finally doing something about the XIM problem.XIM devices trick consoles into believing that KBM users are playing with a controller. However, in a blog post, Blizzard says it has been able to detect KBM players on consoles over the last few Overwatch 2 seasons. It has found that the cheating problem is more prevalent among higher ranked players. The developers say that use of so-called unapproved peripherals is \"very rare\" in lower ranks.During the current season (which started this week), Blizzard will dish out permanent bans to the most extreme users of unapproved peripherals. It will rely on reports from other players and its own data to pinpoint those who are breaking the rules.Starting in Season 11, which should get underway in June, the developers will tackle the issue at a broader level. The first time a console player is detected using an unapproved device on consoles, they'll be banned from Competitive modes for a week. If they keep using KBM or other unapproved peripherals in casual modes, they'll get a season-long Competitive suspension, only have the option of playing with other KBM users in Quick Play and lose access to aim assist features. It's all in the name of fairness.There are accessibility concerns here, though, as some folks simply can't play games with a standard controller. Blizzard says that it has done its \"utmost to ensure that players with accessibility needs will be less likely to trigger our detection.\" The developers say they will tailor their enforcement actions so that folks with accessibility needs can still land a sick Earthshatter or keep healing their teammates.With all that said, Blizzard is looking into adding official KBM support on consoles so folks can play the game that way without negatively impacting controller players. As things stand, console and PC players are separated into separate pools for Competitive play. So to make things fair, Blizzard would need to shuffle console players who want to use a keyboard and mouse into games with other KBM players and no aim assist.The XIM problem isn't exactly new. The Overwatch 2 developers' colleagues at Activision last year started banning Call of Duty players who spoof input devices (or just messing with them, as usual). Ubisoft and Epic have also targeted XIM users in Rainbow Six: Siege and Fortnite, respectively.Blizzard is doing more on other fronts to try to keep Overwatch 2 fair and more enjoyable for the majority of players. It's punishing those who leave in the middle of matches more severely and taking a stronger stance on toxicity in voice and text chat.Meanwhile, there's been a kerfuffle this week related to Overwatch 2 players being banned for using profanity. Those who use slurs or threaten others should obviously face appropriate consequences, but apparently booting out players from a game that has profanity filters for some slightly spicy trash talk is some kind of BS."},{"title":"A correction on Amazon Prime Video subscriptions","text":"Correction, April 18, 7:37PM ET: Amazon has disputed Cord Busters' report, and confirmed the Prime Video-only plan is still available in the US as a standalone, $8.99 monthly subscription.

Publisher Devolver Digital dropped the game\u2019s first trailer on February 1, showcasing frenzied sniper shots and a radioactive art style. A Steam demo highlighting its initial seven stages went live that same day and became a breakout hit during February\u2019s Steam Next Fest. Two months later it landed in full and to broad acclaim. This explosive reveal and rapid release timeline mirrors the game itself \u2014 chaotic but contained, swift and direct, sharp and bright.Though it feels like Children of the Sun popped into existence over the span of two months, it took solo developer Ren\u00e9 Rother more than 20 years to get here. Ren\u00e9 RotherAs a kid in Berlin in the early 2000s, Rother was fascinated by the booming mod community. He spent his time messing around with free Counter-Strike mapping tools and Quake III mods from the demo discs tucked into his PC magazines. Rother daydreamed about having a job in game development, but it never felt like an attainable goal.\u201cIt just didn't seem possible to make games,\u201d he told Engadget. \u201cIt's like it was this huge black box.\u201dRother couldn\u2019t see an easy entry point until the 2010s, when mesh libraries and tools like GameMaker and Unity became more accessible. He discovered a fondness for creating 3D interactive art. But aside from some free online Javascript courses, he didn\u2019t know how to program anything, so his output was limited.\u201cI dabbled into it a little bit, but then got kicked out. Again,\u201d Rother said. \u201cIt was just like the whole entrance barrier was so big.\u201d Ren\u00e9 RotherRother pursued graphic design at university and he found the first two years fulfilling, with a focus on classical art training. By the end of his schooling, though, the lessons covered practical applications like working with clients, and Rother\u2019s vision of a graphic design career smashed into reality.\u201cThere was an eye-opening moment where I felt like, this is not for me,\u201d Rother said.In between classes, Rother was still making games for himself and for jams like Ludum Dare, steadily building up his skillset and cementing his reputation in these spaces as a master of mood.\u201cAtmospheric kind of pieces, walking simulators,\u201d Rother said, recalling his early projects. \u201cAtmosphere was very interesting to me to explore. But I never thought that it was actually something that could turn into a game. I never thought that it would become something that can be sold in a way that it's actually a product.\u201d Ren\u00e9 RotherBy the late 2010s Rother decided he was officially over graphic design and ready to try a job in game development. He applied to a bunch of studios and, in the meantime, picked up odd jobs at a supermarket and as a stagehand, setting up electronics. He eventually secured a gig as a 3D artist at a small studio in Berlin. Meanwhile, his pile of game jam projects and unfinished prototypes continued to grow.\u201cIn that timeframe, Children of the Sun happened,\u201d Rother said.In Children of the Sun, players are The Girl, a woman who escaped the cult that raised her and is now enacting sniper-based revenge on all of its cells, one bullet at a time. In each round, players line up their shot and then control a single bullet as it ricochets through individual cult members. The challenge lies in finding the most speedy, efficient and stylish path of death, earning a spot at the top of the leaderboards.\u201cIt was just a random prototype I started working on,\u201d Rother said. \u201cAnd one Saturday morning I was thinking, \u2018I don't know what I'm doing with my life.'\u201d With an atmospheric prototype and a head full of ennui, Rother emailed Devolver Digital that same day about potentially publishing Children of the Sun.\u201cThe response was basically, \u2018The pitch was shit but the game looks cool,\u2019\u201d Rother said. \u201cAnd then it became a thing.\u201d Ren\u00e9 RotherVisually, Children of the Sun is dazzling. It has a sketchy 3D art style that\u2019s covered in bruise tones, with dark treelines, glowing yellow enemies and layers of texture. Every scene looks like The Girl just took a hit of adrenaline and her senses are on high alert, lending a hectic sense of hyper-vigilance to the entire experience. It\u2019s a game built on instinct.\u201cI didn't make any mood boards,\u201d Rother said. \u201cI didn't prepare [for] it. It was just like, oh, let's make it this color. Ah, let's make it this color\u2026. This is something to very easily get lost in. I spent a lot of time just adjusting the color of grass so it works well with the otherwise purplish tones and these kinds of things. I spent way too much time on the colors.\u201dChildren of the Sun went through multiple visual iterations where Rother played with contrast, depth, fog density and traditional FPS color palettes, before landing on the game\u2019s dreamlike and neon-drenched final form. The residue of this trial and error is still visible beneath Children of the Sun\u2019s frames, and that\u2019s exactly how Rother likes it.1 \/ 13The visual evolution of Children of the SunScreenshots of the game in development \u201cI see it as a big compliment, actually,\u201d he said. \u201cIn paintings, when we talk about visual art, I really like when you can see the brushstrokes. I like when you can still see the lines of the pencil before the painting got made. I like the roughness. I wanted everything to be rough. I didn't want it to be polished.\u201dRother picked up the game\u2019s soundtrack collaborator, experimental ambient composer Aidan Baker, the same way he hooked up with Devolver. Rother was a fan of Baker and his band Nadja, and he wanted a similar droning, slowcore vibe as a backdrop for Children of the Sun. On a whim, Rother sent Baker a casual message asking if he\u2019d like to make music for a video game.\u201cHe was like, \u2018Well I've never done it, so I don't know,\u2019\u201d Rother remembered. \u201cSo we met one evening and then afterwards he was like, \u2018Yeah, let's just do it.\u2019 Instead of just emulating something that I like in the game, I somehow managed to get straight to the source of it. And that was a really nice experience.\u201dFor Rother, Children of the Sun has been a lesson in trusting his gut. He hasn\u2019t found the proper word in English or German to describe the atmosphere he created in the game, but it\u2019s something close to melancholy, spiked with an intense coiled energy and bright, psychedelic clarity. He just knows that it feels right \u2014 visuals, music, mechanics and all.\u201cThat's kind of how I live my life,\u201d Rother said. \u201cNot that I'm, like, super spontaneous or just flip-flopping around with opinions or these kinds of things. It's more about doing things that feel right to me without necessarily knowing why.\u201dWhen he booted up that Quake III demo disc and started making 3D vignettes for game jams, Rother didn\u2019t realize he was building the path that would eventually lead him to a major publishing deal, a collaboration with a musician he admires, a big Steam release and a game about cult sniping called Children of the Sun. When Rother takes a moment to survey his current lot in life, he feels lucky, he said. Ren\u00e9 Rother\u201cI feel like in the last three years, somehow, lots of things fell into my lap,\u201d Rother said. \u201cAlthough I still had to do something for it. I needed to be prepared for this moment, that required work.\u2026 But in the time where I prepared myself, I was not aware that I was preparing myself. So that's how the feeling of luck gets amplified a bit more.\u201d\u201cLuck\u201d is one way to describe it, but \u201cartistic instinct\u201d might be just as fitting. Children of the Sun is available now on Steam for $15."},{"title":"Quicken Simplifi subscriptions are half off through April 21","text":"Subscriptions to the budgeting app Quicken Simplifi are half off through April 21.
